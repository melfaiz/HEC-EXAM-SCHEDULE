# HEC EXAM SCHEDULE

This year, HEC has a new information system for managing courses and course holders, which is more complete than the previous one (my.hec). Many tools that were based on the old data base therefore need to be adapted to the new structure. This is the case of the system used to build the exam schedule. This old system was quite satisfactory, easy to manipulate and very visual (CSS skills required or willingness to learn) but is not at all adapted to the new database structure. This project would consist in adapting the existing tool to the new database structure. A preliminary analysis will have to be carried out to assess whether it is better to start from the existing tool or to create a new tool from scratch.
